# These Cops Must Always Be Enabled!
# These Cops check for things that are *literally* bugs,
#   and no code should ever be released that fails these cops.
#
# The Exclude: [] is crucial here:
#   even if our .rubocop_todo.yml contained exclusions for strict cops, we nullify them here,
#   thus, re-activating these cops for all the files.
#
# These settings must be loaded after any files of "TODOs" that instruct RuboCop to ignore errors.
# Fortunately this project doesn't rely on TODOs, instead relying on a rubocop_gradual lockfile.
