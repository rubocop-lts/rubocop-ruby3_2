# Customizations/Deviations from Standard/Shopify for Ruby Coding Standards

# We want "Exclude" and "Include" directives from different
#   config files to get merged, not overwritten
inherit_mode:
  merge:
    - Exclude
    - Include

require:
  # Loads the Standard Ruby suite of gems, and configures for rubocop-lts:
  - standard-rubocop-lts
  # The goal here is convention over configuration...
  # In light of that, we are well past having convened on Markdown for README docs and such.
  - rubocop-md
  # Rubygems, and Rails apps have Rakefile as a convention, and if they don't, why not?
  # Other Ruby projects don't have a Rakefile by default, so if needed we could add a ruby_vanilla.yml.
  # With Rakefile seems more common than without for projects that bother to install a linter.
  - rubocop-rake
  # RuboCop Gradual can be used in "Require mode", which is a way to replace rubocop with rubocop-gradual:
  - rubocop/gradual/patch

# Rules are overridden in a LIFO stack.
# If rubocop-shopify is loaded first, and standard-rubocop-lts after it,
#   then rubocop-shopify's rules will take precedence.
# This is the opposite of what you might expect.
# Below: rubocop-shopify rules will override standard-rubocop-lts's (i.e. standard's) rules.
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-shopify: rubocop.yml
  standard-rubocop-lts: config/ruby-3.2.yml
