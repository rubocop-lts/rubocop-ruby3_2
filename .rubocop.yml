# Other project will do the following:
#inherit_gem:
#  # Pick one:
#  #  rubocop-ruby3_1: rubocop-lts/rails_rspec.yml # or rubocop-lts/rails.yml w/o rspec
#  #  rubocop-ruby3_1: rubocop-lts/ruby_rspec.yml # or rubocop-lts/ruby.yml w/o rspec
#  # This is a RubyGem and is tested with RSpec, so obviously:
#  rubocop-ruby3_1: rubocop-lts/rubygem_rspec.yml # or rubocop-lts/rubygem.yml w/o rspec
#  # Also, convention over configuration, so obviously:
#  rubocop-ruby3_1: rubocop.yml # for the ruby + rspec

# But we are inside the gem, so we need a different paradigm here.
inherit_from:
  - rubocop-lts/rubygem_rspec.yml
